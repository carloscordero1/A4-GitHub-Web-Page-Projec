            <h3>Loth Cat</h3>
            <img src="https://i1.wp.com/thelegalgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mandalorian-ep-4-loth-cat-concept.jpeg" alt="Loth Cat" class="center">
            
                <p>Loth-cats are members of the tooka family, and native to Lothal, often found in the grassy plains of the Outer Rim planet. 
                    They're small, temperamental creatures, and while at times friendly, are still able hunters with sharp teeth and claws.
                    They have made appearances in Star Wars Rebels. 
                They are carnivorous, and were known to feast on Loth-Rats.
                Loth-cats were very persistent hunters, and would stalk their prey for hours, or even days.
            </p>
                <img src="https://pa1.narvii.com/6466/6bf984403438d1f833ebbe85116bec2be3d2f778_hq.gif" alt="Loth Cat" class="center">
            <p>
                They are family to the Tookas, as their coloration is just slightly different. Loth Cats are usually light brown with dark brown spots and stripes but have also been seen completely white with blue eyes, which is rare. Their legs with claws are completely black.
                Loth Cats are small felines with a long thick fluffy tail, long pointy ears and have a set of 4 sharp claws on each paw (3 claws pointed to the front, one claw to the back). They can become around 1 meters long and can weight around 10 kilos. They have a large mouth but small eyes that can become bigger when stressed, threatned or comfortable.
            </p>

            <p>Loth Cats are native to the Outer Rim planet of Lothal. They can be found wild in the grassy plains. Their normal coloration makes them hard to spot between the high grass. 
                Loth Cats tend to be aggressive due to temper but can also be friendly.</p>

            <h2>Tooka Cat</h2>

            <img src="https://wdwnt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tooka-cat-plush-13-2988074-1200x800.jpg"alt="Tooka" class="center">

          <p>Tookas, also called tooka-cats, were a subspecies of feline cats.They were popular as pets as the carnivores ate many unwanted pests,but were also considered by many to be feral nuisances themselves.
        When properly trained, they could be excellent hunters of pests. One specific breed of tooka was the Loth-cat, native to the planet Lothal.
        Tooka were known to enjoy milk and Tooka were common in the underworld of Coruscant, where they hunted nuna.

        <h2>Biology and appearance</h2>
      <img src="https://www.looper.com/img/gallery/star-wars-the-cat-like-tooka-creatures-explained/intro-1606573970.jpg" alt="Tooka" class="center">
        <p>Tookas could be a variety of colors, such as violet, greenish blue, yellow, dark yellow, fawn, brown, deep purple, and blue-gray.
            They had very long mouths that stretch all the way across their face and could open wide to display long sharp fangs.
            They had a pair of very tall, pointy ears that were usually striped.
            Their neck was rather short, as were their legs, and their paws were very similar to a bird's talons.</p>

        <p> He started out as a normal cat living with his grandparents. Until one day while he was out in the feilds tending to the cows when a cat whom he'd never seen before came up to him and showed him a picture of his mother holding a light sword. The stranger cat then reveiled himself to be none other than Anacats uncle Obi-wan catnobi! 
            Obi-wan then began to explain that Anacat's mother and father were called Jedi who fought for peace and unity in the galaxy who fought against the evil empire trying to control all living beings

        <p> Obi-wan then began to explain how Anacat's parents sent him off to go fight in the war and spoke to Obi-wan about their son. They wanted Anacat to grow up and live the lifes they wish they had, but anacat's curiosity got the better of him when he asked about how his parents were killed
            Obi-wan explained that the emperor of the siths is to blame for his parents demise. Anacat then sword to himself that he would master the force and only use it for good just as how his parents once did
