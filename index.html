            <ul>
                <li>Loth-cats are members of the tooka family, and native to Lothal, often found in the grassy plains of the Outer Rim planet. 
                    They're small, temperamental creatures, and while at times friendly, are still able hunters with sharp teeth and claws.
                    </li>
                    <li>They have made appearances in Star Wars Rebels. </li>
                <li>They are carnivorous, and were known to feast on Loth-Rats.</li>
                <li>Loth-cats were very persistent hunters, and would stalk their prey for hours, or even days.</li>
                </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>They are family to the Tookas, as their coloration is just slightly different. Loth Cats are usually light brown with dark brown spots and stripes but have also been seen completely white with blue eyes, which is rare. Their legs with claws are completely black.</li>
                <li>Loth Cats are small felines with a long thick fluffy tail, long pointy ears and have a set of 4 sharp claws on each paw (3 claws pointed to the front, one claw to the back). They can become around 1 meters long and can weight around 10 kilos. They have a large mouth but small eyes that can become bigger when stressed, threatned or comfortable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Loth Cats are native to the Outer Rim planet of Lothal. They can be found wild in the grassy plains. Their normal coloration makes them hard to spot between the high grass. 
                Loth Cats tend to be aggressive due to temper but can also be friendly.</p>
