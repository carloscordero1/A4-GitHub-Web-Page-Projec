            <h3>Loth Cat</h3>

                <p>Loth-cats are members of the tooka family, and native to Lothal, often found in the grassy plains of the Outer Rim planet. 
                    They're small, temperamental creatures, and while at times friendly, are still able hunters with sharp teeth and claws.
                    They have made appearances in Star Wars Rebels. 
                They are carnivorous, and were known to feast on Loth-Rats.
                Loth-cats were very persistent hunters, and would stalk their prey for hours, or even days.
            </p>

            <p>
                They are family to the Tookas, as their coloration is just slightly different. Loth Cats are usually light brown with dark brown spots and stripes but have also been seen completely white with blue eyes, which is rare. Their legs with claws are completely black.
                Loth Cats are small felines with a long thick fluffy tail, long pointy ears and have a set of 4 sharp claws on each paw (3 claws pointed to the front, one claw to the back). They can become around 1 meters long and can weight around 10 kilos. They have a large mouth but small eyes that can become bigger when stressed, threatned or comfortable.
            </p>

            <p>Loth Cats are native to the Outer Rim planet of Lothal. They can be found wild in the grassy plains. Their normal coloration makes them hard to spot between the high grass. 
                Loth Cats tend to be aggressive due to temper but can also be friendly.</p>

        <p> He started out as a normal cat living with his grandparents. Until one day while he was out in the feilds tending to the cows when a cat whom he'd never seen before came up to him and showed him a picture of his mother holding a light sword. The stranger cat then reveiled himself to be none other than Anacats uncle Obi-wan catnobi! 
            Obi-wan then began to explain that Anacat's mother and father were called Jedi who fought for peace and unity in the galaxy who fought against the evil empire trying to control all living beings

        <p> Obi-wan then began to explain how Anacat's parents sent him off to go fight in the war and spoke to Obi-wan about their son. They wanted Anacat to grow up and live the lifes they wish they had, but anacat's curiosity got the better of him when he asked about how his parents were killed
            Obi-wan explained that the emperor of the siths is to blame for his parents demise. Anacat then sword to himself that he would master the force and only use it for good just as how his parents once did

                        <p>Kitten Leia Catwalker is the twin cat sister of Luke Catwalker and the daughter of Anakin Catwalker and Padmé Amidala. She was born soon after her father became Darth Vader and her mother died, forcing Senator Bail Organa to raise her on Alderaan. Leia rose through the Imperial ranks to become a young Imperial Senator and a Rebel Alliance commander, and she was tasked with delivering the Death Star designs to the Rebellion. She continued to serve the Rebels after the Death Star was destroyed, alongside Luke and Han Solo, with whom she fell in love. She took part in the Battle of Endor, when she assisted in the destruction of the second Death Star and the defeat of the Galactic Empire.</p1>
